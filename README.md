## About B2B

B2B Digital Wallet App is a Progressive Web Application designed to streamline electronic transactions efficiently. Merchants are able to add products of their business to the system and customers can purchase them without the hassle of using physical money. Instead, electronic funds are used as payment. In this day and age, digital transactions are booming as more and more businesses switch to mobile applications to handle online transactions. 

The application provides a QR scanner functionality that reads barcodes and QR codes of products and merchants, respectively. These QR codes are used to uniquely identify the entities that reside in the application. For instance, barcodes are used to identify the product and once scanned, details are provided by the merchant who will then be able to sell that product to its customers. QR codes for merchants are automatically generated upon registration and the customers can use the QR codes to pay for their purchases.

Merchants can also cashout their earnings through the different payment channels available. This includes the bank of their choice, GCash, coins.ph, and Paymaya. Merchants will be notified once the transfer to their preferred payment channel has completed. In addition, merchants purchase vouchers that range from 100, 500, and 1000 denominations that are used to fund their e-wallets.

The developers used the following tools in implementing the digital wallet app:

CSS4 and Bootstrap. The styling of the website, from its aesthetics, to its background colors down to its layout, the developers used Cascading Style Sheets and Bootstrap. Bootstrap helps the layout to be uniform across devices used for accessing the website, especially mobile phones and other smaller devices.

MySQL. The maintenance of the database, the information of users and merchants utilized MySQL, one of the most popular database management system languages for managing database content such as storing and retrieving data.

Laravel 7.24 / PHP 7.4.1. The main programming language the developers used is Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a scripting language for establishing the connection of the webpages to the database and also to process the data that are sent and displayed by HTML. User input such as those in text areas and search fields made use of this programming language. The developers also used PHP to integrate MySQL into the database.
